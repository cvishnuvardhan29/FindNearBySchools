## Key points about this code
1. I have used **MVVM architecture with POP** that makes more effiecient ways to maintain the code and enhancing the reusability and also **best coding patterns**.
2. I have not used any third party libraries as Swift providing the more flexible APIs for example Networking and Parsing the data using URLSession and Codable protocol.
3. The code is completely unit testable and we can improve the code coverage testing the viewmodels.
